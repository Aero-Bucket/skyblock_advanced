# SkyBlock Advanced
## Introduction
SkyBlock Advanced is a completely vanilla, medium difficulty skyblock for 1.16 and 1.17.

This repo will only contain data packs for both versions.
The world save will only be available in the first release, since it is very unlikely to be changed in the future. 

## Usage
Download and extract the 1.16 or 1.17 world zip, locate your Minecraft folder [as guided here](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131551-Where-are-Minecraft-Files-Stored-) and put the world in the 'saves' folder
 
Afer the initial release, only data pack zips will be provided. To update your world, download and extract the 1.16 or 1.17 data pack zip, open the folder `Your Minecraft Folder/saves/skyblock_advanced_116(or 117)/datapacks` and replace the content.
